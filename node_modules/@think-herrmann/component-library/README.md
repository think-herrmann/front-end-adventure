# The Axon Component Library

[ ![Codeship Status for axondev/component-library](https://app.codeship.com/projects/ccc98390-733d-0136-03d7-22e969459fdb/status?branch=master)](https://app.codeship.com/projects/299561)

This repository contains the Component Library for the Herrmann brand (including the Thinker Portal, Axon, and any other / future client-facing applications). The Component Library is intended to be part design reference and part code library. Using the Storybook framework, all Herrmann employees can view and leverage the Component Library as a design reference, since our existing brand/style guide is print-focused. Developers can also add the Component Library to their projects as a dependency and import entire components in React applications, or stylesheets in non-React applications.

The Component Library is owned and maintained by the Platform Team, and is intended to evolve with the company and products we create.  

## Setup the application

From your console run the following commands:

    bundle install
    yarn install

## Running the application

From your console run the following command:

    yarn run storybook

Then browse to `http://localhost:9001`.

## Adding New Components

### Building Your Component

To add a new component, navigate to `component-library/components` and create a new folder with the name of the component you're creating. That folder should include an `index.js` file for the actual component, a `styles.css` file for the styling, and any other files the component will reference (images, tests, etc.). The component should be self-contained, except where you choose to import existing components into your new component and build on those (for example, the Modal component imports the Button component).

### Adding Your Component to storybook

You also need to add your component to Storybook. To do this, open `component-library/stories/index.js` and add your new component to the import list. Then, use the Storybook syntax to add your component as a story. You can read more about this on the Storybook website, but an example is provided below:

    `storiesOf('My Component', module)
    .add('High-level component description goes here',
      withInfo(`
        In-depth component description goes here. Use the Whole Brain walkaround as a guide for the information included. For example: Why was this created? In what circumstances do you imagine its use? When should it NOT be used? What props does it accept? If there are multiple colors or versions of this component, are there any guidelines or rules around how or when a specific version should be used?
      `)(() =>
        <MyComponent
          firstProp={42}
          secondProp="Adams"
        />
      )
    );`

If your component involves multiple different versions that you want to show as a dropdown beneath one header, they should all be added under `storiesOf` using multiple `.add`s for each different variety. See the Button components as an example of this.  

### Exporting Your Component and Building

Once all of this is done and your component is finished and included in Storybook, you need to add an export for your component in `component-library/index.js` and then build using Rollup. From your console, run the following command:  

    yarn run build

When you commit afterwards, be sure to push your changes up to master, not development.
