[**remark**][remark] plugin to [make your typography better][typewriter-habits]
with [**Textr**][textr].

## Install

[npm][]:

```sh
npm install remark-textr
```

## Use

Say we have the following file, `example.md`:

````markdown
## spread operator...

```js
function(...args) { return args; }
```
````

And our script, `example.js`, looks as follows:

```js
var vfile = require('to-vfile')
var remark = require('remark')
var textr = require('remark-textr')

remark()
  .use(textr, {plugins: [ellipses]})
  .process(vfile.readSync('example.md'), function(err, file) {
    if (err) throw err
    console.log(String(file))
  })

// Textr plugin: just a function to replace triple dots to ellipses.
function ellipses(input) {
  return input.replace(/\.{3}/gim, '…')
}
```

Yields:

````markdown
## spread operator…

```js
function(...args) { return args; }
```
````

## API

### `remark().use(textr[, config])`

[Make your typography better][typewriter-habits] with [**Textr**][textr].

##### `config`

###### `config.plugins`

List of [Textr][] plugins (`Array.<string|Function>?`).
If strings are passed in, those are loaded with `require`.
Textr plugins are available on npm, labelled with [textr][textr-plugins]
keyword.
You can also create them yourself, as shown in the example above.

###### `config.options`

[Textr][] options (`Object?`).
For example, you may want to set the [ISO 639][iso] [locale code][locale] of the
content, which is important for stuff like the correct primary and secondary
quotes.
