import {Link} from 'react-router-dom';

# App Overview

The application we use for our frontend challenge is a simple interactive
fiction game. It lets the user progress through a story by following links from
page to page. Some pages perform actions that unlock new parts of the story that
were not previously available. Some paths are dead ends which force the user to
start over from the beginning, or a key checkpoint. 

This page provides technical detail as to how this app actually works. Depending
on your familarity with React, React Router, and Redux, there may be pieces that
don't make complete sense. You can review the <Link
to="/content/frameworks">Frameworks</Link> section for a brief overview on these,
or simply save questions for the interview. Note a full understanding of all
these things isn't necessary to start working on the application, as some key
areas have been stubbed out with TODO's to help interviewees. 

The core of the app is the React component found in `components/adventure-page`.
This component loads content out of the `content/adventure` folder. It will load
which ever file who's base name matches the last part of the url (ie
`/adventure/escape` loads `content/adventure/escape.mdx`)

The files in the adventure folder are MDX files. MDX is a format which allows
you to mix JSX and markdown, making it possible to mix markdown and custom
components, and easily integrate markdown into a React application.

In `components/adventure-page` we make use of webpacks dynamic imports feature
to import every mdx file from `content/adventure`. This gives us an object with
keys corresponding to the base name of the mdx file, and values which are an
object of the following form

```
{
  comoponent: // The React component generated by MDX, which renders the page
              // markdown content
  choices:    // An object of keys and strings which are used to build the links 
              // at the bottom of the page. 
  event:      // An optional function that will trigger story events which
              // unlock new content and options
}
```

During runtime, the `AdventurePage` component does the following

* Extracts the current page name from the url using React Router's
  `useParams` hook
* Uses that name to lookup the correct page in the `pages` object
* Fires the event (if present) as a side effect using React's `useEffect` hook
* Renders the markdown content
* Renders the choices as React Router `Link` tags.

The event functions Redux actions creators, which are processed by the reducers
definted in `src/reducers.js`. These reducers store key information about the
state of the story, and which key events the user has or has not triggered.

The choices object can be either a static object, or a function. If it's a
function, the `Adventure` page component will pass in the `storyEvents` piece of
the redux store 

Outside of the `AdventurePage` component, the `reducers.js` file, and the
`adventure/content` files, most of the rest the application is just boilerplate
and simple content pages built using react and markdown that aren't really
releavnt to the interview.
