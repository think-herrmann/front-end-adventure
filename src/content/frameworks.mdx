# Frameworks Used in This App

To build this app, we use a number of different tools and frameworks. Most of
them are tools we also use in or production applications. **You do NOT have
to learn all of these tools to be successfull in the technical interview.** The
interviewer will help you with any tool specific coding, or we'll focus the
conversation on more general design and architecture questions. However if
you're interested we have outlined the tools and links to their documentation
site here, along with some explanation of why we use these

## React Router

React router is a client side library that handles letting users navigate around
your application to different urls without a full page refresh. This way, if
your application loads alot of data from the server, you can load it once, and
not have to reload while the user navigates. It also creates a faster feeling
experience since the user never sees a full page refresh.

## Redux / Redux Toolkit

Redux is a tool to manage the "state" of your application. State is any data
that comes from the server, or is generated by user behaviors and actions. Redux
creates a single "global" store for state that any component can easily access.
This way you don't have to pass props down through the entire React component
tree. Redux includes Redux Toolkit, which is a set of utilities that make using
redux easier

## MDX

MDX is a file format and associated parsers that allows you to mix JSX and
markdown. It makes it easier to create rich content experiences that easily
integrate with react. [Docs](https://mdxjs.com/)
