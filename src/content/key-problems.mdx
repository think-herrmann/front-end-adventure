# Key Problems

Below are outlined some of the key problems we'd like you to consider and
discuss during the technical interview. As a reminder you don't have to address
them all, but come prepared to talk about a mix of technical and design related
issues, depending on your skillset

## Tracking and Visualizing a users path

The interactive fiction game at the heart of this app has many different paths
the user can take through the story, though only one of those paths leads to a
winning scenario. We want a visualization that will help users see the path
they've taken so far. During the interview we'll ask you to talk about what that
visualization might look like, and how to use react and redux to generate data
needed for that visualization.

If it's helpful for you to understand the story in creating a visualization, you
can review the outline of the story at <Link to="/content/story-outline">Story
Outline</Link>

can check out our [Component Library](https://myelin.herrmannsolutions.net/)

## Improve the Story UI

The story UI is fairly sparse and simplistic. We'll ask you how you might
propose improving that UI, and then make some key changes to implement your
fixes is real time

## Accessibility

What changes need to be made to the app as is to improve accessibilty. As we add
other features like the story tracking, how do we ensure it remains accessible?
