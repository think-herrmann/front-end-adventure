# Welcome to the Herrmann Frontend Coding Exercise

<BrainyBunch maxWidth={400} />

This page explains what to expect and how to prepare for your technical
interview with Herrmann. Here at Herrmann we do our technical interviews as pair
programming sessions, where you work together with an interview to solve some
interesting problems in a made up application. You are not expected to prepare
extensively for the interview, and the process is meant to be fairly collaborative 

## Preparing for the Techincal Interview

* Go to https://github.com/think-herrmann/front-end-adventure
* Clone the repp and follow the installation instructions to get the application
  and running 
* Spend 15 - 30 minutes getting familar with the basic flow and setup of the
  app. You can read <Link to="/content/app-overview" >App Overview</Link> for a high level explanation
* Read through the FAQs at <Link to="/content/faqs">FAQs</Link>
* Read through the <Link to="/content/key-problems">Key Problems</Link> page to
  understand the key problems and areas we'll discuss during the interview
* Spend 30-45 minutes thinking through some high level solutions to those
  problems. You don't need to do any implementation work outside the interview,
  but we want you to be prepared to hit the ground running and make some initial
  suggestions as to the direction you want to interview to go in. You don't need
  a plan for every problem, just pick the ones you feel best demonstrate your
  skillset and capabilities. 
* Make sure you have the app running on a computer you can join a zoom video call
  from, and do a screen share.

## During the Technical Interview

The technical interview itself will be a pair programming session where we
explore some of the following objectives in a free form manner. 

* How can we create a UI/UX that lets users see the path they've taken through
  their adventure?
* How do we implement page tracking so we can chart that adventure?
* Where should we consider refactoring to better support those objectives?
* How can improve the general look and feel of the adventure content pages?
* What can we do to make sure the experience is accessible?

You can get more detail about these problems by reading <Link
to="/content/key-problems">Key Problems</Link>

We'll give you alot of freedom to decide where you want to focus, but we will
steer the conversation to make sure we spend at least some time on primarily
technical topics like data flow and management, and some time on primarily
design related topics like UI/UX and accessibility.

The interview is less of a test and more of a conversation. You're allowed to
ask for help, look things up on google, etc. You're even allowed to ask the
interviewer to take over and help code things that might be related to a tool or
framework you're not very familar with. We're not interested in trying to
evaluate your detailed technical knowledge and experience with every tool here,
but instead want a sense of your general skillset, capabilities, and approach to
problem solving and communication.

Unless otherwise arranged or discussed beforehand, we will expect you to have
the app running on your computer and you will be the one writing most of the
code. As needed the interviewer can help with snippets sent over zoom chat, but
you'll still need to be the one copying and editing.
