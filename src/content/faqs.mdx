# FAQS

## I'm just starting to learn Javascript/React/Redux/etc. Can I still succeed in the interview?

Definitely. We recognize that the front end role can mean alot of different
things to different people, and that people come to the table with different
mixes of technical and design related skills. We've tried to develop a process
that lets them show off both so we get a full picture of each candidate. If
you're a more design oriented developer, then you can focus on that part of the
challenge. We'll still want to spend sometime on the technical, just to
understand where you are at, but that's not the only thing we're interested in.

## What skills do I need to be successful in this interview?

You should be familar enough with git/github to get this project running locally
on your machine prior to the interview. You should also know at least some
javascript, enough to read and follow existing code at a high level. You also
need to be capable of indepdent design, and familar with writing static CSS and
HTML. 

## How long am I expected to spend preparing for this interview?

We suggest you try not to take more than 2 hours. You're not expected to have
anything done by the time the interview starts, just expected to be able to
immediately launch into a productive conversation. Get familar with the app, the
key problems, spend a little time thinking about high level solutions, and then
you should be good.

## Does an app like this really need all these frameworks?

Probably not, but we wanted something that looks similar to the kinds of
applications you'll work with on the job. The tools and frameworks used here are
mostly ones we use frequently on our production apps. They may be overkill for a
small app like this one, but we wanted a representative case study for the interview
