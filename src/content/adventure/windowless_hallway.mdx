# Windowless Hallway

At the end of the windowless hallway the hall splits like a T, heading off in
either direction. There's another sign here

> ← Guard House (Exit)
>   Experimental Room →

To the left you hear sounds of conversation. You can make out the light of a
door, and a small wire guard station just before it.

To the right, you see another door just a few feet down the hall. You shouldn't
linger here for long, you feel very exposed.
