# Shimmering Clearing

You come up to the clearing, where the stream splits. You cross over the bridge
and pause to examine the fork in the stream behind you. You look closer, and you
realize there's something strange about the water. Both sides of the fork are
completely identical. The same rocks, the same blades of grass on the banks. You
look closely and realize you even see the same fish, swimming in synchronizeed
motion on both sides of the split.

You look closely at the exact spot where the stream splits. The strange shimmer
you saw from a distance earlier is even more strongly pronounced here.
