# Terminal

The terminal appears to be unlocked and has a curses style command line
interface open. The title at the top says "Experimental Simulation Subject
Monitoring". Below that there's a table with a list of names in one column, and
the status "In Simulation" repeated next to them in another column. At the
bottom of the screen there are a few buttons, including one that catches your
eye labeled "Release Subjects"
