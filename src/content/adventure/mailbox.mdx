# Open the mailbox

You open the mailbox and reach inside. You find a small, yellowed piece of paper
with a map drawn on it. It looks like it's meant to be a map of the surrounding
area, but strangely it has 2 paths drawn on it, one leading north and one
leading east. You look up again, and now, suddenly you do see a second path
leading off to the east. You're certain that wasn't there when you looked
before.
