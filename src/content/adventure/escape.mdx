# Escape

You cautiously walk towards the shimmering. As you get closer you start to feel
a strange tingle. Then the headband you're wearing starts to hum and pulse. You start
to feel a strange sort of dissassociation, as if you're leaving your own body.
The tingle fades and you realize you're somehow looking at yourself from the
outside as your body continues towards the split. You see your body double, and
then there are two of you, standing next to eachother in the two different
streams. 

The air fills with a strange sound, and then the landscape seems to melt before
your eyes. It goes dark. For a moment, you feel lost and disoriented, but then
you feel yourself breathing, and you realize you're back in your body. You open
your eyes and see a plain white tile ceiling above you, and a bright flourescent
light. 

You flex your fingers and toes, and then try to slowly sit up. The room you're
in is empty excepting a few monitors and your bed. You're hooked up to the
monitors with some sort of strange wires. You reach up to touch your head, and
realize there's a headband on it, not unlike the one you were wearing earlier.

You remove it and stand up. Looking around you can see the room has one exit,
straight in front of you.
