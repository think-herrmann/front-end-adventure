# Spoiler Alert!!!


This is the outline for the actual story, if you want to explore the different
paths or if understanding the actual story helps you create a vizualization.
There are basically two initial paths, the house path, where you discover what's
going on by going inside the house and discovering a mysterious computer, and
the electronic diary within it, or the east path, where you discover what's
going on by exploring outside until you come across a mysterious glitch that
gives you a clue as to what's happening.

Both of these paths merge when you figure out how to escape from the simulation
you're trapped in. Then we start the escape sequence where you attempt to escape
from the facility. Here there are a number of dead end paths that lead to your
capture again, and only one path where you narrowly escape.
