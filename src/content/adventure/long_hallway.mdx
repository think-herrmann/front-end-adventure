# Long Hallway

You walk down the long hallway, approaching the guard house. You try to be quiet
and stick to the shadows, but eventually you get close enough that you feel like
you can't go any farther without attracting attention.

From here you can see two guards in the guard house, playing a game of cards.
Past them is a door that clearly leads outside the building.
