# Security Center

You open the door to the security center. The guards turn to stare and for a
moment everyone is quiet and confused. Then suddenly one of the guards stands up
and says "Hey, this one's loose". The rest of them quickly spring into action,
drawing guns, or moving to tackle you. You briefly try to fight them off, but
there are too many. You feel a blow to the back of you head before blacking out.
As your conciousness fades, you wonder how you thought this wouldn't go badly
when you opened that door.
