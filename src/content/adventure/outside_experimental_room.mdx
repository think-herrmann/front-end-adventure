# Outside Experimental Room

You come up to the door to the room, and peer in through the window at the top.
You see dozens of beds with people lying in them, hooked up to a strange
assortment of tubes, and wearing headbands like you were earlier. Otherwise the
room looks empty. 

The door is locked, but through the window you can see the headbands all have
small wires coming out of them and leading up the the ceiling. The wires join
together and join into a bigger bundle, heading to an opening in the ceiling at
the corner of the room. You can't be sure, but it appears as if the bundle heads
out towards the hall with a window that heads to the right, back towards the
room where you woke up.

In the other direction, you see the hallway with the T intersection.
