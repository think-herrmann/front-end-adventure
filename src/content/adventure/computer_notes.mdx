# At the Computer

You sit down at the computer. The screen is open with a diagram and some sort of
schematics. It looks like a headband, with all sorts of wires running through
it. At the bottom, the page is labeled 3/3. You hit the back arrow key to see
the previous page. On it you see the following text

> using components harvested from the split stream ensures the device has the
> same underlying properties from the glitch. When activitated it safely
> dissociates the wearer from their simulated body, ensuring the body can safely
> pass through the glitch without disrupting consciousness. While the system can
> handle duplicate copies of non-essential simulation data, duplicating the
> subject causes key functions to crash, eventually causing a full panic which
> ends the simulation. 

You try to go back again to read the first page, but when you do, it just says 

> FILE CORRUPTED, DATA NOT FOUND

You return the computer back to the page with the schematic. This time you
notice a small button at the bottom of the page that says 

> Unlock device safe
