# Head East

You head east following the map. You pass a few small trees and and a stream and
some bushes, all of which are marked on the map. According to the map you're
headed to some sort of landmark, but you can't tell what. The map shows a
picture of a strange blue star, with strange symbols you can't read around it.

As you grow close you can see you're headed for a clearing. The air ahead looks
strange, almost like it's shimmering. You can see the stream splits in two up
ahead. The path continues with a small bridge leading over one of the branches.
