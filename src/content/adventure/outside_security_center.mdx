# Outside the security center

As you approach the security center you hear voices come from inside. You press
close against the wall and carefully peer in through the window in the door. You
see a handful of uniformed guards sitting at terminals. They're chatting amongst
themselves, and it doesn't appear that anyone is actually watching the screens
though. 

Behind you, the hall goes around a corner back to the room you wake up in. In
front you the hall continues to a 'T' fork.
