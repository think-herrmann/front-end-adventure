# Hallway outside the room

You are standing in the middle of a hallway in front of the door outside the
room you woke up in. There's a quiet industrial sounding whir of industrial air
conditioning and ventalization. The walls are a institutional white, with eeire,
too dark flourscents above. The hallway goes off to your left and to your right.
You see a sign in front of you

> ← Server Room
>   Security Center →

In both directions the hall turns a corner before heading up and away from where
you stand.
