# The Shimmering

You cross the bridge back to the other side and stand on a gravely bank just a few
feet back from the split. The water runs over small stones and pebbles right in
front of your feet.

From the other side the shimmering is even stronger. From this angle you can see
the fork is nothing like anything you've seen before. The stream splits like a
beam of light through glass. Right by the shimmering,  The two sides are
completely identical in every way. But as you look closer you can see things
start to diverge a few feet away, until obvious differences like the bridge on
one side, and not on the other are clearly visible.
