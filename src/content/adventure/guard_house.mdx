# Guard House

You crawl along the ground towards the guard house, hoping that if you stay low
to the ground, neither guard will see you. You're just past the house when one
of them looks up. You freeze. He looks at you and says "Hey, where are you
going?". You stand up to run, but before you get two steps you feel a sharp pain
in your back and then electricy runs through your body. You collapse on the
ground and it fades to black
