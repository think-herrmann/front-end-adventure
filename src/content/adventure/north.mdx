# Going North

You start walking north along the path. It's leads straight ahead through the
wide open field. Off to either side you see nothing bug grass for miles. There's
a nice breeze and the temperature is pleasant, but the landscape is eeirly
empty. 

After about half and hour you start to see something ahead of you in the
distance, another small house, not much unlike the one you started from. As you
get closer you start to get the strange feeling it is the one you started from.
Wait, have you some how gone in a circle?
