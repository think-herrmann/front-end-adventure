# Hall with window

This hall has a long window that spans almost the whole hallway. It's dingy, and
dirty, and the glass is frosted so you can't really see out of it, but it's nice
too have at least some natural light. 

On the opposite wall there is a sign

> ← Experimental Room
>   Server Room →
