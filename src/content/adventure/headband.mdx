# The Headband

When you press the button a drawer you didn't see before slides out from the
table. In the drawer, you see a headband, just like the one on the screen. It
seems to shimmer strangely. 

You pick it up and feel a strange buzzing in your hands. There's a hinge in the
middle of the band that allows it to fold up small enough to fit into your
pocket. 

You fold it over itself and and slip it into your front pocket.
