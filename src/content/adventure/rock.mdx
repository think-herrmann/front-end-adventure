# Throwing a Rock in the Stream

You pickup a rock from the bank and throw it towards where the stream splits.
When it hits the split, you suddently see two rocks, each headed down a
different side of the split, but otherwise following the same trajectory. They
both land in the stream at the same time with a solid splash.
