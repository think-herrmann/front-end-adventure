## Preparing for the Techincal Interview


## During the Technical Interview

The technical interview itself will be a pair programming session where we
explore some of the following objectives in a free form manner. 

* How can we create a UI/UX that lets users see the path they've taken through
  their adventure?
* How do we implement page tracking so we can chart that adventure?
* Where should we consider refactoring to better support those objectives?
* How can improve the general look and feel of the adventure content pages?
* What can we do to make sure the experience is accessible?

We'll give you alot of freedom to decide where you want to focus, but we will
steer the conversation to make sure we spend at least some time on primarily
technical topics like data flow and management, and some time on primarily
design related topics like UI/UX and accessibility.

The interview is less of a test and more of a conversation. You're allowed to
ask for help, look things up on google, etc. You're even allowed to ask the
interviewer to take over and help code things that might be related to a tool or
framework you're not very familar with. We're not interested in trying to
evaluate your detailed technical knowledge and experience with every tool here,
but instead want a sense of your general skillset, capabilities, and approach to
problem solving.
